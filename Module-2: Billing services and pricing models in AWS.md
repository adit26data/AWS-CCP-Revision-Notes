AWS Pricing and Billing Models

The main cost factors at AWS are: Compute, Storage and Outbound network traffic and data transfer.
The inbound data transfer/ traffic is free for all users. The AWS follows some core philosophies in its pricing model-

1.**PAY AS YOU GO PRICING:**
   You only pay for what you use, how much you use and how long you use the services. There is not additional upfront expense. This leads to econimical expenditure on the part of the client and there is reduced operational expenditure. Focus is on demand of the resources when needed.

2.**PAY LESS BY USING MORE:**
   We can realise the volume discounts of AWS in terms of tiered pricing and savings model. The volume discounts are economical in a nature and are cost controlling.

3.**PAY LESS AS AWS GROWS:**
    As the number of users increase the cost of a particular service decreases. As the services tools are enhanced, the faster high performing versions replace the current tools without extra charge as well.

4.**CUSTOM PRICING:**
    There is custom based pricing for specialised needs of the businesses as well

5.**AWS FREE TIER**:
   Beginner friendly pack for 1 year where multiple Amazon services are provided for free.

### Total Cost of Ownership
The traditional infrastructure of computing requires huge captial expense and needs the client to guess upfront all the requirements he or she needs. This makes it inflexible and less scalable. Unlike Cloud computing models, there is variable expense and the CSP is responsible for running and maintaining the services, will you are concerned only about using them for you applications and there is a provision of easy scalability and adaptablility. 
To evaluate the on premises expenditure and the same expenditure in cloud you need the TCO OR TOTAL COST OWNERSHIP.
TCO is basically a financial estimate of the helping in identifying the direct and indirect costs in a system. Used for budgeting and optimising the cost needs.
Considerations to be made are:
  1. **SERVER COSTS**- involves server administration costs, virtualisation costs, hardware costs and power, cooling and spacing costs.
  2. **NETWORKING COSTS**- involves load balancing, network adminstration and local area network setup costs
  3. **STORAGE COSTS**-involves the storage administration, disks and fibre channel switches.
  4. **IT LABOUR COSTS**- involves adminstration costs

Responsible for calculating and estimating the monthly costs, estimating the optimised lower costs and how we can reduce them. Explore the price points and determine the available instances that we might need in the future as well.

Addtional benefits to consider in TCO are:
1. **HARD BENEFITS**: reduction in expenditure of space and facility , procurement cycle of software and hardware resources and reduction in OpEx and administrative personnel.
2. **SOFT BENEFITS**: reuse of services along with increases developer productivity and agile business process and increased global reach

TCO takes in hard benefits as quantifiable physical benefits while soft benefits are value points that are not easily quantified.
