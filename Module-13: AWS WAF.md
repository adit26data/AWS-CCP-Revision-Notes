## Chapter 13
**AWS WELL ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK**

Cloud architects need to collaborate with the technology team and the investors to ensure that the appropriate tech stacks are being used and the business value is being delivered as demonstratable results to the investors.  He or she needs to make sure that the 3 fundamental principles - people, technology and business are perfectly aligned.
They review cloud solutions and 4 considerations need to be made while reviewing any cloud solutions- performance,,elasticity, cost and security.
When it comes to AWS WAF , we have 5 pillars-

**1. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE:**
focuses on the monitoring of the services and their systems to deliver business needs and to continually improve on supporting procedures and processes.

_**The key funtions are :**_

a. monitoring and automating the operational procedures

b. event response

c. defining standards to manage daily operations
   
_**5 design principles are:**_

   a. Code implementation to reduce error
   
   b. document annotation
   
   c. failure anticipation
   
   d. automation of daily procedures and refining them
   
   e. making small , reversible changes frequently

**2. SECURITY:**
focuses on the security of the aws assets, applications, resources, environments, accounts and the services from outside attack and other vulnerabilities to maintain the business values using risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

_**The key functions are:**_

a. access control implementation

b. service control policies

c. protecting the environment

d. patching up vulnerabilities

_**The 7 design principles are:**_

a. implementing IAM policies

b. automatic security

c. encryption

d. automatic traceability

e. multi layered security

f. preparation for security events

g. applying security groups


**3. RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY :**
Focuses on ability of the system to provide data whenever user desires and to recover from failure and prevent it activerly.

_**The key functions are:**_

a.setting up

b. cross project requirements

c. recovery planning

d. handling changes

_**5 design principles are:**_

a. test recoverability procedures

b. automatic recoverability

c. scale horizontally to increase aggregate systems for higher availability

d. automating changes

e. fault tolerant and resilient design with data redundancy in multiple AZs and data centers with synchronous and asynchronous replication

**4. PERFORMANCE**
focus on usage of IT resource and compute resources to deliver maximum business value and to use the best cloud solutions for handling the high demands of the customers effeciently

_**The key functions are:**_

a. choosing the right resources and types per workloads

b. Monitoring the performance levels

c. Making informed decisions to improve and evolve business effeciency

_**5 design principles are:**_

a. resilient design and democratising the technology

b. globalisation

c. serverless architecture usage

d. experimentation

e. mechanical sympathy


**5. COST OPTIMISATION:**
focuses on delivering the business needs with the lowest cost

_**The key functions are:**_

a. understanding and controlling money expenditure

b. selecting and using most appropriate resource types

c. analysing spending over time

d. scaling to meet spikes

_**The 5 design principles are:**_

a. adopting a consumption model

b. measure effeciency

c. stop spending money over data operations

d. using managed services to decrease cost 

e. analyse attribute expenditure
