### Client Server Model
In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) â€“ a type of virtual server.

### Cloud computing:
Cloud computing is defined as on demand delivery of compute resources, databases, storage applications and other reosurces over the internet with a pay as you go pricing model.Its main aim is to get rid of undifferentiated heavy IT lifting.

### Evolution of hosting:
  1. **DEDICATED SERVERS** for running a single business. Expensive and require high maintainance
  2. **VIRTUAL SERVERS** for single business but uses virtualisation to break up the various operations of the application to have better resource utilisation.
  3. **SHARED SERVERS** having one single physical asset utilised by many businesses
  4. **CLOUD SERVERS** using distributed computing and providing resources over the internet with a high level of abstraction.

### CSP
    Cloud Service Providers are the firms that provide standard and customised cloud services to the business for their needs with a metered billing model. 
    Types:
         1. TIER 1 : MARKET WIDE OFFERING.  eg: AWS
         2. TIER 2: SPECIALISED NATURE. eg: IBM
         3. TIER 3: Offer core IaaS. eg: Vultr

### The advantages of cloud computing over the traditional infrastructure/ model of computation are:
1.Trading traditional capital expense CAPEX with operational expense OPEX:
The traditional hardware based infrastructure implementation requires guessing upfront expenditure cost, spacing , maximum capacity and procurement strategy even before a single physical asset is bought.It is time consuming and expensive.Can lead to under utilisation of resources and scaling and adapatability isses. In these cases the OpeX model offered by the clou dis benefical as one only pays for what is used and how much it is used.

2.Going Global in minutes: 
Globalisation is easier with cloud as deployment is done over the internet while in case of physical infrastructure implementation, it is not possible to connect or transfer data around different places easily.

3. No limits over capacity in cloud as compared to physical model , as everything is automated and software based leading to incresed scalability.

4. Increased Speed and Agility

5. Economies of scale : More the users accumuluted in a cloud service, lesser its cost by the service provider

6. More customer focus and business focus rather than infrastructure focus

Other advantages includes: elasiticiy, fault tolerance, data redundancy, diasaster recovery, reliable, highly available and secure.

### 3 MODELS OF CLOUD IMPLEMENTATION ARE:
  1. **IaaS**: INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE
            The existing legacy physical infrastructure where the user has the maximum control and flexibility over the IT resources
  2. **PaaS**: PLATFORM AS A SERVICE
            The kind of model where the management part of the user is taken away and the sole focus of the customer is deployment and automation of their product. eg: HEROKU
  3. **SaaS**: SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE
            The kind of service where the sole focus of the customer is software utilisation for its product with underlying mechanism handled by the service provider. eg: SALESFORCE

### 3 MODELS OF CLOUD DEPLOYMENT ARE:
   1. **PRIVATE CLOUD/ ON PREMISES**: Uses the infrastructure of onpremises to store the data. Much like the legacy IT infrastructure that provides dedicated resources for the applications and products with little room for scalability and adapatability. Use virtualisation and resource management for your applications.
   2. **PUBLIC CLOUD**: The model where the applications are created/ migrated into an all cloud environment. Complete cloud based solutions are provided and increased scalability and speed are there.
   3. **HYBRID CLOUD**: The model to connect the on premises infrastructure to the cloud utility resources. Mainly for growing your implementation while connecting cloud to internal systems.


#### Introduction to AWS 
A web service is basically a software that available over the internet that uses standardised XML/JSON for API requests.
AWS or AWAZON WEB SERVICES is a secure cloud platform that provides various management, compute, databases, networking , storage resources along with a plethora of other IT tools. It is a highly flexible and cohesive service following the pay as you go model of pricing.There are 23 categories of servies provided out of which some were just listed previously.
We can access the AWS using:
  1. CLI
  2. SDK
  3. MANAGEMENT CONSOLE

#### Cloud Adoption Framework or AWS CAF
It is a document that helps the organisation to travel and follow an accelerated path of migrating their existing management and IT infrastructure to the cloud sucessfully. The main aim is to align the PEOPLE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY ASPECTS perfectly for the business continuity.
There are 6 perspectives here:
1. **BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE**:The IT must be perfectly aligned with the buiness goals and the IT investments should be traced back to demonstratable business research. It includes IT finance, strategy and risk management.
2. **PEOPLE PERSPECTIVE**: There should be extreme focus on proper staffing, recruitment and training of employees to handle the cloud model of infrastructure in order to build an agile organisation. The gaps must be identified and areas of improvement nust be evaluated in light to the organisation needs. Includes staffing, resource management, career management and organsational change management.
3. **GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE**: Includes portfolio management, project management, license management etc. The main aim is to ensure that the skills and the processes align with the business goals and the IT investments are maximised to produce results and reduce the business risks.
4. **PLATFORM PERSPECTIVE**: Includes all IT resources of the platform. There must be proper communication of the nature of the IT infrastructure and the needs. Must be able to describe the architecture of the target state environment.
5. **SECURITY PERSPECTIVE**: Includes all the processes of IAM, policy management, detective controls, protection and incident response. Aim is that the organisation meets its security objectives while cloud migration like: auditibility, control, visiility etc
6. **OPERATIONS PERSPECTIVE**:Includes application monitoring and system monitoring with Business Analytics and continuity plans. Defines current business activities and processes how they must be changed to adopt a cloud framework.
